# Cloudamatic Mu Master Installation
There are two paths to creating a Mu Master.  

- **Typical Installation**: The simplest and recommended path is to use our CloudFormation script to configure an appropriate Virtual Private Cloud and master with all features enabled, including both a command line and Jenkins GUI user interface.
- **Custom Installation:** If you prefer, you can also create your own VPC and manually provision a Mu Master.  This gives you more control over the shape of the master VPC and individual settings

For detailed instructions on both installation techniques see [our Wiki Installation page](https://github.com/cloudamatic/mu/wiki/Install-Home)
